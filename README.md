Recreation of google snake and simulation of perfect play.

This project's primary purpose is to efficiently run simulations of google snake games and to calculate statistics for rarity of google snake speedruns.
Currently, there is only the recreation of google snake wall mainboard made.
If you would like to play this recreation, go to the url, about:blank, open the devtools console by pressing f12, ctrl+shift+i, or right clicking and clicking the inspect element option, and paste in the code from   recreation of wall mainboard.js   into the devtools console and press enter. If you try to paste in the code and an error comes up preventing you from pasting, type "allow pasting" into the console and press enter. Then you'll be able to paste in the code.
